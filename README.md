## Description


`PROJECT DESCRIPTION:` The Employee Directory is a simple contact list directory of a random JSON object of characters.  Each character has an icon image, name, phone number, email and date of birth.  The object of this app is to display the list of contacts with their information, and offer a search bar that dynamically, through the use of React JS, will filter out your contact list.  You can also sort alphabetically and reversed by clicking on the name table header icon.


`WHO IS IT FOR?:` This app is designed for someone wanting to view a contact list render your contacts by a search parameter and an order.
